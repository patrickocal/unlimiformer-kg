Our baseline dataset is the Hugging Face version of GovReport \cite{huang2021efficient}, a well-established LD summarization dataset with many practical applications. To generate the required datasets, we use REBEL \cite{huguet2021rebel}, a pre-trained, end-to-end relation extraction model that can be found on Hugging Face here\footnote{https://huggingface.co/Babelscape/rebel-large}, to perform named-entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE).
