\subsection*{GovReport}
GovReport is a well-established LD summarization dataset that is both publicly available and ready-to-use. We use it because it is a large and popular dataset with many real-world applications. The Hugging Face GovReport\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/ccdv/govreport-summarization} dataset has an approximate $90/5/5\%$ split of approximately $19,500$ document-summary pairs.
