\subsection*{GovReport}
The GovReport dataset is a well-established long-document summarization datasets that is both publicly available and ready-to-use. We use it because it is a large and popluar
dataset that has many real-world applications. The Hugging Face GovReport \footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/ccdv/govreport-summarization} dataset has an 
approximate $90/5/5\%$ split of approximately $19.5$k document-summary pairs.
