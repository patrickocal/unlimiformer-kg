\subsection*{Appropriateness of the BART Model}
When training our model, we chose to feed the relational data of our KGs as tokens into \texttt{unlimiformer}, as opposed to embedding the KGs as separate relations into vector space. We believe that our approach is more appropriate as it allows us to better utilize the the \texttt{unlimiformer} framework, while preserving as much of the KG structure as possible within the dataset.
