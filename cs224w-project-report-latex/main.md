# Introduction

In this blog post, we explore how knowledge graphs (KGs) can be applied
to improve the accuracy of the `unlimiformer` long-range transformer for
the task of long document (LD) summarization.

# Problem Statement

Augmenting large language models (LLMs) to handle long documents using
retrieval-based methods is a highly active area of research. The key
weakness of modern transformer-based LLMs is the token limit, or context
window of attention. For instance, the context window of ChatGPT-3.5 is
4,096 tokens, while the average novel contains well over 100,000 tokens.

`Unlimiformer` [@bertsch2023unlimiformer], a recent retrieval-based
method for augmenting LLMs at the decoder level, is the first long-range
transformer to support unlimited length inputs. The key innovation of
`unlimiformer` is to create a datastore of encodings which correspond to
each token in the original document, and use the $k$-nearest neighbors
($k$-NN) algorithm to select the $k$ most relevant tokens in the
datastore during decoding.

Since KGs store richer information than plain datastores, we predict
that feeding KG relational data as tokens into `unlimiformer` can
enhance the model's understanding of LDs, like how a *dramatis personae*
section can aid a reader in understanding a complicated novel by
highlighting key relationships between characters. Thus, we hypothesize
that the KG-augmented `unlimiformer` model will produce more accurate LD
summaries than the baseline `unlimiformer` model.

# Methodology

We compare and contrast the LD summaries generated by 3
transformer-based LLM models. Firstly, we train the facebook/BART base
model using the `unlimiformer` augmentation, which operates on the
entire LD and employs the $k$-NN algorithm. Secondly, we repeat the
previous exercise but with KGs as inputs instead of LDs. Thirdly, we
repeat the previous exercise with string inputs of concatenated KGs and
LDs (in this order).

# Creating the KGs and Datasets

Our baseline dataset is the Hugging Face version of GovReport
[@huang2021efficient], a well-established LD summarization dataset with
many practical applications. To generate the required datasets, we use
REBEL [@huguet2021rebel], a pre-trained, end-to-end relation extraction
model that can be found on Hugging Face here[^2], to perform
named-entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE).

## GovReport {#govreport .unnumbered}

\*\*Why GovReport, and how is it used?\*\*

## REBEL {#rebel .unnumbered}

We chose REBEL because it is end-to-end (it finds entities and relations
at the same time), open-source, and easy to implement using Hugging
Face. Also, according to the DocRED paper by Yao et al [@yao2019DocRED],
pretrained REBEL yields the best joint entity and relation extraction
(NER and RE) result compared with the benchmark among all models
sampled, with a relation F1 score of 47.1[^3].

Since the pre-trained REBEL model has a token limit, we chose to split
the LD into 128-token chunks before extracting head-relation-tail
triplets from each chunk. Next, we used NetworkX to assemble the
triplets and form a directed KG. The code for our REBEL implementation
can be found here[^4].

\*\*Why 128 span length?\*\*

\*\*Why extract triplets (and not extract triplets typed)?\*\*

## Alternatives to REBEL {#alternatives-to-rebel .unnumbered}

Other means of performing NER and RE we considered include spaCy-LLM,
DyGIE++, and LlamaIndex. spaCy-LLM[^5] is a package that integrates LLMs
into natural language processing (NLP) pipelines provided by spaCy, an
industry-standard NLP library. In particular, its built-in
`spacy.REL.v1`[^6] component supports RE with both zero-shot and
few-shot prompting, but relies on an upstream NER component for entity
extraction.

DyGIE++ is an RE component that refines and scores text spans designed
to capture both intra-sentence and cross-sentence context. We cloned the
code from the official GitHub repository linked here[^7] and attempted
to replicate the process of training a model for RE, but were
unsuccessful due to technical difficulties.

Finally, LlamaIndex, a framework for connecting data sources for LLMs,
has a class called `KnowledgeGraphIndex`[^8] which is compatible with
FAISS, the datastore that `unlimiformer` uses to conduct $k$-NN searches
of top-level hidden state encodings, which would simplify our task of
NER and RE.

\*\*Why unlimiformer, and what is it?\*\*

### Background on BART

BART, like other transformer-based models, is considered adept at
handling structured inputs due to several key features of its
architecture and design.

\*\*Structured Inputs

Structured inputs refer to data that is organized in a predictable,
often hierarchical manner, with clear relationships between different
parts. This contrasts with unstructured data, like free-form text, where
the organization and relationships are not as explicitly defined.
Examples of structured inputs include:

\- Databases or tables where data is organized in rows and columns. -
XML or JSON data, where elements are nested and have defined
relationships. - Knowledge graphs, where information is represented as
entities and relationships (triples).

\*\*Why BART Handles Structured Inputs Well\*\*

1\. \*\*Self-Attention Mechanism\*\*: BART's transformer architecture
uses a self-attention mechanism, which allows it to consider the entire
input sequence at once. This enables the model to understand
relationships between different parts of the input, essential for
structured data.

2\. \*\*Contextual Understanding\*\*: BART can capture context from both
left and right of each token in the input sequence. This bi-directional
context is crucial for understanding structured inputs, where the
meaning often depends on the surrounding elements.

3\. \*\*Layered Encoding\*\*: The layered structure of transformers
enables them to capture and encode different levels of abstraction,
which is beneficial for understanding hierarchical and nested structures
in the input.

4\. \*\*Pre-training on Diverse Data\*\*: BART is pre-trained on a wide
range of data, including structured formats. This pre-training helps it
to learn patterns and structures that are common in various types of
data.

5\. \*\*Flexibility in Input Representation\*\*: BART can handle
sequences with special tokens and delimiters, allowing it to adapt to
different types of structured inputs. For example, it can process inputs
where parts of the data are segmented or highlighted using special
tokens.

6\. \*\*Adaptability to Task-Specific Structures\*\*: With fine-tuning,
BART can adapt to specific types of structured inputs relevant to a
particular task, enhancing its ability to process and generate
meaningful outputs based on that structure.

In summary, BART's ability to process and understand the entire input
sequence contextually, along with its adaptability and pre-training on
diverse data, makes it well-suited for handling structured inputs. This
capability allows it to effectively process and generate outputs based
on inputs like knowledge graphs, tables, or other structured data forms.
We chose to use the beginning of sequence (BOS, '\<s\>') and end of
sequence (EOS, '\</s\>') tokens to separate triples in our knowledge
graphs (KGs) with the intent of aligning BART's understanding of
sequence boundaries, this approach has specific implications:

1\. \*\*Clear Segmentation of Information\*\*: Using BOS and EOS tokens
to delimit triples in the KG makes each triple a distinct segment from
the model's perspective. This is beneficial since we want the model to
treat each triple as an independent unit of information since we expect
our GovReport KGs to be such that the relationships within triples
contain key information.

2\. \*\*Facilitating Attention Across Segments\*\*: This segmentation
should help the model's attention mechanism focus on each triple
individually, potentially enhancing the model's ability to capture the
nuances of each relationship within the KG.

3\. \*\*Model Adaptation to Structured Inputs\*\*: Given that BART is
designed to handle structured text, using BOS and EOS tokens in this way
could aid the model in better understanding and generating summaries
based on the structured nature of KGs. It aligns with the model's
pre-existing mechanisms for processing text.

4\. \*\*Potential for Contextual Integration\*\*: While each triple is
treated as a separate sequence, the overall structure still allows the
model to integrate these segments contextually. The model can learn to
understand the KG as a whole, even though it processes each triple
individually.

5\. \*\*Efficient Processing of Smaller Units\*\*: By breaking down the
KG into smaller segments, the model might process each unit more
efficiently, especially if the triples are concise and the relationships
within them are straightforward.

In this context, the slower training times you observed might not be due
to the tokenization strategy per se but could involve other factors such
as the complexity of the relationships in the KGs, the adaptation of the
model to this unique structuring of inputs, or other computational
aspects related to how the BART model processes these inputs.

Your approach aligns with the design principles of transformer models
like BART, which are adept at handling structured inputs. The key would
be to ensure that the rest of your training pipeline, including data
preprocessing and model fine-tuning, is optimized to leverage this
structure effectively.

## Appropriateness of the BART Model {#appropriateness-of-the-bart-model .unnumbered}

When training our model, we chose to feed the relational data of our KGs
as tokens into `unlimiformer`, as opposed to embedding the KGs as
separate relations into vector space. We believe that our approach is
more appropriate as it allows us to better utilize the the
`unlimiformer` framework, while preserving as much of the KG structure
as possible within the dataset.

# Results

\*\*How did our model perform compared to the baseline? Explanation?\*\*

\*\*Why is the average summary 800 words and not 500 words?\*\*

Interpreting the performance differences between models trained on long
documents (LD) and knowledge graphs (KG) based on the provided metrics
involves considering what each metric measures and how that relates to
the nature of the inputs:

1\. \*\*ROUGE Scores\*\*: - \*\*ROUGE-1 (LD: 23, KG: 40)\*\*: This
measures the overlap of unigrams (individual words) between the
generated summary and the reference summary. The substantially higher
score for KG suggests that the KG-based model is better at capturing key
content words. This could be because KGs, being structured and concise,
might enable the model to focus on essential terms more effectively. -
\*\*ROUGE-2 (LD: 11.74, KG: 11.47)\*\*: This metric evaluates bigram
overlap, indicating how well the model captures phrases and specific
content. The similar scores suggest that both models are nearly equally
effective at capturing phrase-level information, though the LD model has
a slight edge. - \*\*ROUGE-L (LD: 14.7, KG: 17.7)\*\*: ROUGE-L assesses
the longest common subsequence, which reflects sentence-level structure
and coherence. The higher score for KG indicates better preservation of
sentence structure or flow from the KG inputs.

2\. \*\*BERTScore\*\*: - \*\*Precision (LD: 0.69, KG: 0.58)\*\*:
Precision measures how much of the content in the generated summary is
relevant or present in the reference summary. The higher precision for
LD implies that it might be better at generating content closely aligned
with the reference, likely due to the richer context provided by the
long document. - \*\*Recall (LD: 0.52, KG: 0.57)\*\*: Recall assesses
how much of the reference summary is captured in the generated summary.
The higher recall for KG suggests it is better at including essential
points from the reference summary, possibly due to the distilled and
focused nature of KGs. - \*\*F1/Aggregated BERTScore (LD: 0.59, KG:
0.57)\*\*: This balanced metric considers both precision and recall. The
scores are quite close, indicating that overall, both models are
similarly effective in terms of content relevance and coverage, though
the LD model has a marginal advantage.

Given these results after 8000 training steps:

\- The KG-based model excels in capturing key content words and
maintaining sentence structure, likely due to the concise and structured
nature of KGs. - The LD-based model, despite its lower performance in
some ROUGE metrics, achieves higher precision in BERTScore, suggesting
its strength in generating summaries that are more aligned with the
content and style of the reference summaries. This might be due to the
rich, contextual information available in long documents. - The marginal
differences in ROUGE-2 and BERTScore/F1 indicate that both models have
their strengths and weaknesses. The LD model seems to be better for
generating precise content, while the KG model is more effective in
covering essential information and maintaining structure.

In conclusion, each model has its advantages depending on the desired
outcome of the summary: whether the focus is on precise content
alignment (LD) or on covering key points and maintaining structure (KG).
Continued training and further optimization could enhance the
performance of both models, potentially narrowing these gaps.
