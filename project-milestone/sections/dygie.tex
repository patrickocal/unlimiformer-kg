\subsection*{DyGIE++} Another relation extraction method we explored for
building KGs is DyGIE++ which refines and scores text spans designed to capture
both intra-sentence and cross-sentence context. We have cloned the code from
the official GitHub repository (\url{https://github.com/dwadden/dygiepp}) and
attempted to replicate the process of training a model for relation extraction
on the SciERC dataset, but have not yet been successful due to technical
difficulties. To resolve this issue, we aim to raise a GitHub issue and
continue to debug as needed, in anticipation that DyGIE++ may be used later on
in our project.
