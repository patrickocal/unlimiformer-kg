Tristin asked a good question. What is the form of the KG? In the simple case, it will be just like in rebel (head, relation, tail) eg 
[["Harry Potter", "friend of", "Ron Weasley"],
["Harry Potter", "enemy of", "Voldemort"],
...]. 

But check this out:

In the above, each entity comes with a dict!

It could also be in the form: https://github.com/MrGranddy/Harry-Potter-Knowledge-Graph/blob/master/graph.json
{"head" : ["Harry Potter", "Harry Potter", "Ron Weasley", ...], "relation" : ["friend", "enemy", ...], "tail" : ["Ron Weasley", "Voldemort", ...]}
